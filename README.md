# RedditScrape
Scrapes (somewhat so far)user defined posts from Reddit for YouTubers
I'm trying to make a reddit scraper with an in built TTS converter.
It also uses an external program called Balcon (i've #'d it out in the code), with a Daniel MLG voice preset, but I dont know how to code it so that others can use it too, more specifically I don't know how to use user-defined directories. So currently it uses Google TTS.
From what I understand, I'd have to make a gui with a browse button and a few entry boxes, but I haven't reached that level yet.

code runs alright but there are things which can be much simpler, something I don't know how to perform.
I've mentioned everything in the .py
If the balcon code doesnt work, it's probably because of the missing daniel preset, here is the link https://www.dropbox.com/s/xoadpr0ftcnyza0/Daniel%2022Khz%20MLG%20voice.exe?dl=0

So long and thanks for all the fish.
